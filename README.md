# flat-mcp-client
Fast Local Agents with Tools (mcp-client edition) is a lightweight package for connecting local (self-hosted) LLMs to tooling and data and prototyping agentic flows.  The philosophy behind this codebase is streamlined invocation of standard inferencing APIs (ollama, vllm via OpenAI interface compatibility) without relying on other agent frameworks!
