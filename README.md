# flat-mcp-client
*F*ast *L*ocal *A*gents with *T*ools (mcp-client edition) is a lightweight package for connecting local (self-hosted) LLMs to tooling+data and for prototyping agentic flows.  The philosophy behind this codebase is streamlined invocation of standard inferencing APIs (ollama, vllm via OpenAI interface compatibility) without relying on other agent frameworks!
